# Project 9 - Front-end Dashboard

This repo contains all the source code to run the Project 9 micro API.

## 1. General information

To start this project, you are free to use Docker or not. In this documentation, we will see several methods to launch the project easily.

## 2. Project (**without Docker**)

### 2.1 Prerequisites

- [NodeJS (**version 12.18**)](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

If you are working with several versions of NodeJS, we recommend you install [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). This tool will allow you to easily manage your NodeJS versions.

### 2.2 Launching the project

- Forker the repository
- Clone it into your computer.
- The `yarn` command will allow you to install the dependencies.
- The `yarn dev` command will allow you to run the micro API.


## 3. Project (**with Docker**)

### 2.1 Prerequisites

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

### 2.2 Starting the project

- The `docker image build --no-cache -t micro-api .` command will allow you to build your image.
- The `docker container run --name micro-api -p 3000:3000 -dt micro-api yarn` command will allow you to create your Docker container and run your image on port 3000.
- The `docker container stop micro-api` command will allow you to stop your micro-api.
- The `docker container rm micro-api` command will allow you to delete your micro-api container.

### 2.3 Vscode and container remotes

Finally, if you have VsCode, you can easily launch your project in a docker environment.

You will need the [Remote Development extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack). Once you have this extension installed, just click on the `Reopen in Container` button.

Once in the container, run the `yarn dev` command.

## 4. Endpoints

### 4.1 Possible endpoints

This project includes four endpoints that you will be able to use: 

- `http://localhost:3000/user/${userId}` - retrieves information from a user.
- `http://localhost:3000/user/${userId}/activity` - retrieves a user's activity day by day with kilograms and calories.
- `http://localhost:3000/user/${userId}/average-sessions` - retrieves the average sessions of a user per day.
- `http://localhost:3000/user/${userId}/performance` - retrieves a user's performance (energy, endurance, etc.).


**Warning, currently only two users have been mocked. They have userId 12 and 18 respectively.**

### 4.2 Examples of queries

- `http://localhost:3000/user/12/performances` - Retrieves the performance of the user with id 12
- `http://localhost:3000/user/18` - Retrieves the user's main information 18.
